# Auto_PPSD

You can generate automatically the PPSD for a multiple stations in a seismological network, save them in npz format, and finally, plot them.

For run this code, you need a dataless file that contain all information about the stations in your seismological network. In my case, I used the dataless file of the RSSB seismological network (https://www.fdsn.org/networks/detail/BT/). 

Code-> Auto_PPSD.py
Dataless-> BT_UNALv5.dataless
